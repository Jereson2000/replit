Repository for holding replit related projects.
Mainly just for the fullstackopen course.

I opted to create a bash script for deployment 
since I don't need to allow replit to access the
whole codebase I can create this specified repo for
holding the deployment. Also when I will create commits
and push them to git replit won't pull them if they are
unfinished.
